                <h3>Ecological uniqueness and zooplankton biodiversity in semi-arid subterranean environments:</h3>
                <p>Ecological uniqueness and zooplankton biodiversity in semi-arid subterranean environments Description: Subterranean environments in the Brazilian semi-arid region have already been identified as biodiversity hotspots, but they are susceptible to degradation due to the various anthropogenic activities taking place in the region. Studies involving subterranean aquatic communities are scarce, especially when it comes to zooplankton communities. In view of this, this project aims to use the alpha-diversity already investigated and environmental data to identify environmentally unique environments (local contribution to beta-diversity - LCBD), and thus assess the contribution of species to the beta-diversity (SCBD) of zooplankton in the subterranean environments of the semi-arid region. We also intend to describe at least one new species of Copepoda already recognised, access the banks of dormant forms of zooplankton present in the sediment and the epostax community in order to better understand the composition of the communities and their dynamics. Finally, we hope to develop tools for scientific dissemination (e-books, booklets and panels) and inclusion of people with visual impairments (3D model printing) to highlight the importance of subterranean aquatic environments and their zooplankton biodiversity. We hope to generate relevant information and direct conservation actions by understanding the dynamics of the beta diversity of zooplankton in subterranean environments in relation to their seasonal variations (dry and rainy periods) and ecosystems (terrestrial and lotic), as well as adding knowledge in relation to the composition and dynamics of alpha and beta diversity through the bank of dormant forms. The scientific knowledge will be disseminated in an accessible way, in order to familiarise and make people from the tourist and educational sectors aware of the importance of subterranean aquatic environments and their zooplankton biodiversity. Finally, the implementation of the project addresses one of the main gaps in knowledge about Brazilian underground biodiversity, contributing to the fulfilment of components 1, 4 and 5 of the National Program for the Conservation of Speleological Heritage and to the academic training of researchers in the field of speleology.</p>

                <h3>Impact of contaminants on the hatching of dormant zooplankton eggs (Cladocera, Copepoda and Rotifera):</h3>
                <p>Little is known about the susceptibility of dormant zooplankton eggs (microcrustaceans and rotifers) exposed to the impacts of human activities, including eutrophication, acidification and chemical contamination by pesticides. Given this knowledge gap, the overall aim of this project is to assess how contaminants commonly applied to sugarcane crops affect the hatching and viability of dormant eggs and, consequently, an important mechanism for recolonising zooplankton after anthropogenic disturbances. To this end, we will carry out a hatching experiment in the laboratory, in which sediments from natural ponds containing dormant eggs will be exposed separately to fipronil (insecticide), vinasse (fertiliser), and a mixture of these contaminants. At the end of the experiment, we will compare the properties of the hatched zooplankton community exposed to the contaminants and to a control treatment.</p>

                <h3>Zooplankton Biodiversity Monitoring Programme in Response to the Impacts of the Córrego do Feijão Mine B1 Dam Failure in Brumadinho, MG:</h3>
                <p>This project aims to monitor zooplankton biodiversity in aquatic ecosystems impacted by the wave of tailings from the Fundão dam (Brumadinho, MG). The impacts extended to various aquatic ecosystems (river channels, marginal lagoons and reservoirs). The project aims to describe the current status of zooplankton biodiversity and to identify species that are bioindicators of mining impacts.</p>

                <h3>Canoe of Knowledge: Aquatic biodiversity and its bioindication potential in the waters of Ouro Preto:</h3>
                <p>The main objective of this proposal is to contribute to the dissemination of knowledge about aquatic biodiversity and its importance for maintaining ecosystem services and bioindication in the aquatic ecosystems surrounding the city of Ouro Preto. Aquatic ecosystems are under increasing threat, especially due to the expansion of the urban network, lack of sanitation, use and occupation of the landscape and mining activities, among others. Studies have shown that aquatic ecosystems provide countless ecosystem services (human health, leisure, buffering pollutants, biomass production, etc.), but this information ends up being limited to academia, without reaching society, a fundamental participant in any initiative to conserve biodiversity and ecosystems. In this sense, this proposal aims to contribute to the dissemination of scientific information on the aquatic ecosystems surrounding the historic city of Ouro Preto. To this end, the aim is to obtain representative samples of these environments and to publicise the results in association with UFOP undergraduate students, schools and society in general in Ouro Preto. To publicise the results, lectures and exhibitions will be held, as well as using media such as UFOP Radio and the laboratory's Instagram (LAECO).At the end of the project, we hope to have contributed to the dissemination of knowledge, scientific literacy and all social actions that result in reflective and concrete actions related to recognising the ecosystem value of aquatic environments and their biodiversity.</p>
